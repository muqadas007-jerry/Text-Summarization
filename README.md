# üìù Text Summarization using Extractive and Abstractive Methods

This project focuses on summarizing large text documents using two approaches: extractive and abstractive summarization. The goal is to condense lengthy information while preserving key ideas, making it easier to understand and process.

---

## üîß Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

To begin the project, essential libraries were installed including spaCy, transformers, and NLTK. These tools provide natural language processing capabilities and access to pre-trained models needed for text summarization tasks.

---

## üßπ Step 2: Text Preprocessing

The text was first cleaned to remove unnecessary elements such as HTML tags and extra whitespace. This ensures that the input to the summarization algorithms is well-formatted and free from noise that could affect the results.

---

## üß† Step 3: Extractive Summarization

In the extractive approach, spaCy was used to tokenize the text into sentences and words. Sentences were scored based on the frequency of meaningful words, ignoring common stop words. The top-ranking sentences were then selected to create a summary that retains the core content of the original article.

---

## ü§ñ Step 4: Abstractive Summarization

The abstractive method was performed using a pre-trained transformer model (BART from Facebook AI). Unlike extractive summarization, this approach generates a new, human-like summary by understanding and paraphrasing the input text, rather than just extracting parts of it.

---

## üìÑ Step 5: Applying the Model

A sample article was used to demonstrate both summarization techniques. After preprocessing, the extractive summary highlighted the most important original sentences, while the abstractive model produced a more natural and concise summary.

---

## ‚úÖ Results and Output

The extractive summary gave a direct but slightly robotic version of the main points, useful for quick overviews. The abstractive summary, on the other hand, was smoother and easier to read, showing the advantage of transformer-based models in generating high-quality text.

---

## üìö Conclusion

This project successfully illustrates how both extractive and abstractive summarization methods can be applied using Python-based tools. It provides a foundational understanding for those interested in natural language processing, automated summarization, or building intelligent document analysis systems.
